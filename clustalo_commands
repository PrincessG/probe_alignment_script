##### Hello! This is where I'm keeping my command line calls for running clustal omega


###write all the sequences that need to be aligned into one fasta file using biopython.

### pass the alignment on to clustal o
##A typical invocation would be: clustalo -i my-in-seqs.fa -o my-out-seqs.fa -v

#clustalo -i
