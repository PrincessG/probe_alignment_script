probe_alignment_script
======================
This is the readme file to run the probe-alignment_script. Just enter terminal and run

>python location/of/probe_alignment_script

To pull down the initial version of the script. From within terminal navigate to the coding directory withing the research folder. Then type

>git clone http://github.com/PrincessG/probe_alignment_script.git

To set things up on a directory on your computer from within terminal navigate to the github directory within the acanthomorph folder. Then type the following:

>git remote add upstream https://github.com/PrincessG/probe_alignment_script.git

If you haven't done so already, assign the original repository to a remote called "upstream"
>git fetch upstream



As of 1.21.2013 I have done everything above so all you have to do not is pull down the most recent version of the script. This will pull in changes not present in your local repository, without modifying your files
 
git merge upstream
